        <hr>
        <p>
          Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. He is the son of journalists Anna and Nils
          Torvalds, and the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole
          Torvalds. Both of his parents were campus radicals at the University of
          Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority.
          Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American
          chemist, although in the book Rebel Code Linux and the Open Source Revolution,
          Torvalds is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the
          Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this makes him half "Nobel
          Prize–winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character".
          <br />
          <br />
          Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki between 1988 and 1996,
          graduating with a master's degree in computer science from NODES research
          group.  His academic career was interrupted after his first year of study when
          he joined the Finnish Army Uusimaa brigade, in the summer of 1989, selecting
          the 11-month officer training program to fulfill the mandatory military service
          of Finland. In the army he held the rank of Second Lieutenant, with the role of
          a ballistic calculation officer. Torvalds bought computer science professor
          Andrew Tanenbaum's book Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, in which
          Tanenbaum describes MINIX, an educational stripped-down version of Unix. The
          book changed Torvalds's life: he was fascinated by the clear structure of Unix
          and its underlying philosophy. In 1990, he resumed his university studies, and
          was exposed to UNIX for the first time, in the form of a DEC MicroVAX running
          ULTRIX. His M.Sc. thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.
          <br />
          <br />
          His interest in computers began with a Commodore VIC-20, at the age of 11
          in 1981, initially programming in BASIC – and later in assembly language. After
          the VIC-20 he purchased a Sinclair QL, which he modified extensively,
          especially its operating system. "Because it was so hard to get software for
          it in Finland, Linus wrote his own assembler and editor (in addition to
          Pac-Man graphics libraries)" for the QL, as well as a few games.
          He is known to have written a Pac-Man clone named Cool Man. On January 5,
          1991  he purchased an Intel 80386-based clone of IBM PC before
          receiving his MINIX copy, which in turn enabled him to begin work on Linux.

          <dd>On April 23, 2014, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
            Engineers named Torvalds as the 2014 recipient of the IEEE Computer
            Society's Computer Pioneer Award. The Computer Pioneer Award was
            established in 1981 by the IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors
            to recognize and honor the vision of those whose efforts resulted
            in the creation and continued vitality of the computer industry.
            The award is presented to outstanding individuals whose main
            contribution to the concepts and development of the computer
            field was made at least 15 years earlier.
