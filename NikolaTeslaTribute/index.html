       <li>Jul 10 1856
Nikola Tesla Is Born to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan, Austrian
Empire near the town of Gospić, in the territory of modern-day Croatia.   </li>

 <li>1875
Tesla Enrolls At Austrian Polytechnic and begins his studies in mechanical and
electrical engineering. </li>

 <li>1882
Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle used in
alternators and pioneered the use of this. </li>

 <li>1885 Nikola Tesla quits working for Edison. Tesla claims he was offered
   US$50,000 (~ US$1.1 million in 2007, adjusted for inflation) if he redesigned
    Edison's inefficient motor but never recieved the payment. </li>

 <li>1887 TheW ar of Currents era begins. During the initial years of
   electricity distribution, Edison's direct current was the standard for the
   United States. </li>

 <li>May 16 1888 Tesla Delivers Lecture: A New System of Alternating Current
   Motors and Transformers </li>

 <li>Jul 30 1891 Nikola Tesla becomes a citizen of the United States  at the
   age of 35. </li>

 <li>1901 Nikola Tesla began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility ca. 1898,
   and in 1901, construction began on the land near Long Island Sound.  </li>


 <li>1915 Tesla and Edison ignored by Nobel Prize committee. </li>


 <li>Jul 10 1934 The New York Times publicizes Nikola Tesla's particle Beam
   research. </li>

 <li>Jan 7, 1943 Nikola Tesla died of heart failure alone in room 3327 of the
    New Yorker Hotel. </li>

 <li>1960 The tesla (symbol T) is the SI derived unit of magnetic field B (which
    is also known as "magnetic flux density" and "magnetic induction"). </li>

        <h3 class="text-center"> ALTERNATE CURRENT </h3>
        <p> Alternating current (AC), is an electric current in which the flow of electric charge periodically reverses direction, whereas in direct current (DC, also dc), the flow of electric charge is only in one direction. The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct, as when they modify current or voltage. <br><br>

AC is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences. The usual waveform of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a sine wave. In certain applications, different waveforms are used, such as triangular or square waves.<br><br>

Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. These types of alternating current carry information encoded (or modulated) onto the AC signal, such as sound (audio) or images (video). These currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission.</p>

      <h3 class="text-center"> TESLA COIL </h3>
      <p>A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit invented by Nikola Tesla around 1891. It is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.<br><br>

Tesla used these coils to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, X-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and the transmission of electrical energy without wires. Tesla coil circuits were used commercially in sparkgap radio transmitters for wireless telegraphy until the 1920s, and in medical equipment such as electrotherapy and violet ray devices. Today their main use is for entertainment and educational displays, although small coils are still used today as leak detectors for high vacuum systems.</p>

      <h3 class="text-center"> REMOTE RADIO CONTROL </h3>
      <p>      In 1898 Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled boat—which he dubbed "teleautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. The crowd that witnessed the demonstration made outrageous claims about the workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy, and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside. Tesla tried to sell his idea to the U.S. military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest. Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs.  Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate "Teleautomatics" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.</p>
