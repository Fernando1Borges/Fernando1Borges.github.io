It is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. The trie can insert and find strings in O(L) time where L is the length of the word. This can be more advantageous in certain situations over a hash table when you want to find words that have the same prefix in common and other similar cases. A trie can be met with in coding interviews but also can be useful in real world applications in software engineering. For example, auto complete text, orthographic corrector and other similar cases can be done very fast with a trie. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Tries were first used by Rene de la Briandais in 1959.

It is the basis of data comparison programs like the diff utility, and for version control systems like Git. The idea is to find the longest subsequence to all the sequences, most often involving only two. This is a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking the problem down into smaller sub problems. Each sub problem is solved just once, it’s solution is stored so that the next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing it’s solution, it is returned from memory. This technique of storing solutions to sub problems to be retrieved later when needed is called ‘memoization.’</p>\r\n          \r\n            <p>The naive solution for this problem would be to generate all possible subsequences and find the longest matching subsequence. This solution is exponential in terms of time complexity. Because this problem has the following two properties it can be approached with a dynamic programming technique. This problem has an <u>optimal substructure</u>. This means that it can be broken down into smaller and simpler subproblems. This problem also has <u>overlapping subproblems</u> which means that the sub problems repeat themselves. These two properties make this problem solvable by a dynamic programming technique.</p>\r\n            <p>The first property, the optimal substructure, is that it is composed of repeating sub problems. Suppose that two strings end with the same letter. Removing that letter and adding it to the resulting substring, you are left with two shorter strings. The solution can be found by repeating this process on the shorter strings until there are no letters left. If the last letters are not the same, the answer can be found by finding the max of either substring A with the last letter removed compared with substring B or substring A compared with substring B with the last letter removed.</p>\r\n            <p>The second property, the overlapping subproblems, means that in the above described recursive method the same problem is repeatedly solved.

This means that problem is divided into smaller subproblems for which a solution is very simple. There are two parts, one the divide part and then the merge part. The input array is divided into half and recursively called on each half. The base case is the empty array. Once the sub part is only one item long, the merging starts. Two sub sections are merged with the lower item taking the position  before the higher item. All sub sections are merged until finally the last two halves are merged. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>RUN TIME</strong>\r\n            <p>What is the run time for this algorithm? \r\n            The merge part of the algorithm takes O(n) time because the array needs to be traversed once, assigning the lower of the two items to the current array position.

Finding permutations is one of the fundamental problems of computing and provides the basis for backtracking problems. However permutation problems are encountered less frequently in real world applications.</p>\r\n            <strong>HISTORY</strong>\r\n            \r\n            <p>This algorithm was first proposed by B. R. Heap in a paper in \r\n                The Computer Journal in 1963.

It first iterates through the array and for each item finds the all possible permutations of length - 1 of the array. The recursive function works like so. It accepts the array and the size of it. It calls itself recursively, with the size of it getting shorter by one each time. When the size equals 1 it prints out the array and returns. Inside the for loop, if the size of the array is odd, a swap between the first and the last or size-1 positions occurs.</p>\r\n            <p> The loop continues and another recursive call is made on the new altered array. Again if the size variable is equal to one, the array is printed and the function returns. The loop continues and again, since the size is the same in this loop, in our case it is even, another swap is made.</p>\r\n            <p> The reason why this works is intuitively difficult to get. The wikipedia article even had an incorrect version on its page for a long time because it is often memorized and therefore it is easy to make a mistake.</p>\r\n            <p> <a target="_blank" class="plain_link" href="http://ruslanledesma.com/2016/06/17/why-does-heap-work.html">This article</a> provides a good explanation of why this works.
