**accomplished:**

- bot tutorials:
    - language generation tutorial
    - created a LUIS resource and app
- researched 'knowledge' capabilities of bot


**bot feature ideas:**

- make a knowledge base
    - essentially discover intent, find out what the user wants to know, and find that information
    - present that information [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-pattern-knowledge-base?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
- make the bot ask the user questions such as:
    - what are you thoughts about meditation?
    - what is your experience with meditation?
    - what kind of meditation are you interested in?
- make the bot suggest the best kind of meditation based on the users answers
- Other bot features:
    - answer 'frequently asked questions' on meditation, buddhism, spirituality, zen, religion, mindfulness
    - train AI model on such buddhist texts
    - use LUIS - NLP based intent recognition, combined with 'search' and 'QnA Maker' [Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-pattern-knowledge-base?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#luis-and-qna-maker)
