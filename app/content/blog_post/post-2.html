<p>Jest is a testing framework maintained by Facebook to test React apps. </p>

<h3>Install and Configure</h3>
<code>$ yarn add —dev jest</code>

<p>If you started your app with create-react-app boilerplate a lot of the configuration will already exist. To start
  testing all you need to do is run npm test.</p>
<p>The file that you are testing should reside in a file that has the same name with .test.js ending.
  This file should reside in mirror directory structure vis a vi it’s counterpart. </p>
<p>Import the file at the top of the page. Typically you would create a wrapper ''describe'' function for the main piece
  of code being tested with nested ''describe'' statements for each smaller sub feature.
  Each feature is tested with a ''it'' function, the first parameter is a string describing this feature and giving it a
  title. The next parameter is a function holding the main test logic.
  Each assertion is tested with expect(some code here).toEqual(what it should equal)</p>
<p>Here''s an example.</p>
<pre>
          <code>
            describe(''Name of what''s being tested, () => {

                  describe(''name of function tested'', () => {

                      it(''description of path being tested'', () => {

                          /* code logic here */

                          expect(
                              /* some function input */
                          ).toEqual(
                              /* expected function output */
                          )
                      });
                  });
              });
          </code>
        </pre>
